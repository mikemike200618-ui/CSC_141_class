# The first print statement outputs the original list of buffet items
# The elements at index 0 and index 3 are modified to "pasta" and
# "rice" respectively, replacing "pizza" and "bread"
# The append method is used to add "cake" and "ice cream" to the end
# of the buffet list
# The second print statement outputs the modified list of buffet items
# showing the changes made to the original list
